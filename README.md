🔐 Multi-Layer Cyber Attack Detection & Correlation System

This project implements a multi-layer cybersecurity monitoring system that detects and correlates multiple security events to identify attack chains rather than isolated incidents. It simulates how real-world security operations detect advanced, multi-stage cyber threats.

🚀 Key Features

Detects multiple security threats across different layers

Correlates events to identify end-to-end attack patterns

Focuses on behavioral and activity-based detection

Modular design for easy extension and testing

🛡️ Threat Scenarios Covered

Phishing email detection

Suspicious login activity

Abnormal user behavior patterns

Unauthorized or unusual data access

Instead of treating these events independently, the system correlates them to flag potential coordinated attacks.

🧠 System Architecture

The system is structured in multiple layers:

Event Collection Layer – Captures logs and activity data

Detection Layer – Identifies suspicious behavior at each stage

Correlation Layer – Links related alerts into attack chains

Alerting Layer – Flags high-risk security incidents

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Log & activity analysis techniques

Rule-based detection and correlation logic

Modular scripts for extensibility

(Tech stack may evolve as the project progresses.)

📂 Project Status

🚧 Ongoing Project
Currently under active development with plans to:

Improve correlation logic

Add real-world datasets and logs

Enhance alert prioritization

🎯 Use Case

This project demonstrates how modern security systems move beyond single-alert detection to holistic threat analysis, making it useful for learning cybersecurity concepts, SOC workflows, and security monitoring design.
